# ChatGPT Prompt Engineering

In this project, the focus is on best practices for effectively utilizing the OpenAI GPT-3.5-based language model, known as ChatGPT, for various tasks. Specifically, we will explore techniques for instruction tuning, performing iterative prompting, summarizing text, inferring information, and transforming given inputs.
It also presents the opportunity to build an automated bot that replies to customer reviews/emails. Also a custom chatbot tailored for pizza ordering has been implemented, that showcases the practical application of prompt engineering techniques.
